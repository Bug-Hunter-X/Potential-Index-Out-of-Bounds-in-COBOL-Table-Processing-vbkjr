This repository demonstrates a potential index-out-of-bounds error in COBOL when working with tables. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides a corrected version. The issue arises from subtle differences in how COBOL handles array indexing and the potential for off-by-one errors or unexpected behavior related to loop boundaries.  The solution demonstrates a safer approach to avoid index issues.
